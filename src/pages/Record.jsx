          Kohli holds a prominent place in the annals of Indian cricket. He has
          the distinction of being the only cricketer to have been named the
          Player of the Tournament in the T20 World Cup on two separate
          occasions, in 2014 and 2016.[128] In terms of ODI centuries, he ranks
          first with 50.[129] He surpassed Sachin Tendulkar's tally of 49 ODI
          tons and achieved this feat on 15 November 2023 in the semifinal of
          the 2023 Cricket World Cup, while also becoming the first player to
          score more than 700 runs in a single edition of the tournament.[130]
          Furthermore, in international cricket, Kohli has amassed 80 centuries,
          second only to Sachin Tendulkar's 100 centuries.
